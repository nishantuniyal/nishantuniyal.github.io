# How Did I Build This Website

## Why Hugo

An older version of the website used Jekyll as a static site generator. I decided to ditch Jekyll in favor of Hugo. Hugo is a static site generator written in Golang, which has been gaining popularity and is blazing fast and simple.

Why I did not use Pelican, a static site generator in Python, despite being a Pythonista?

* I wanted to challenge myself with something I was unfamiliar with subsequently learning a new skill.
* The Github stars for Hugo speaks for its popularity.

## Getting Started

## Templates

## Setting up Disqus to Enable Commenting on Blog Posts

I thought it was a good idea to enable commenting on blog posts to enable the user to suggest improvements or even point out my mistakes. I believe that discussions are the best way to gain a good understanding of a topic.

## Deploying on Github Pages

One of the reasons in choosing Hugo for building this personal website was how trivial it was to deploy the website on Github pages.
