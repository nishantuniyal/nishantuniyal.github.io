# How Did I Build This Website

## Why Jekyll?

After doing some online research I finally settled on Jekyll. I researched Pelican, a static site generator in Python, however I decided to go with Jekyll for the reasons mentioned below:

* I wanted to challenge myself with something I was unfamiliar with subsequently learning a new skill
* The Github stars for Jekyll speaks for its popularity

## Getting started

## Templates

## Setting up Disqus to enable commenting on blog posts?

I thought it was a good idea to enable commenting on blog posts to enable the user to suggest improvements or even point out my mistakes. I believe that discussions are the best way to gain a good understanding of a topic.

## Deploying on Github pages

One of the reasons in choosing Jekyll for building this personal website was how trivial it was to deploy the website on Github pages.
